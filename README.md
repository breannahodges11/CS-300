# CS-300

•	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

We were asked to create a program that would print a sample schedule and course information for a college advising team.

•	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Data structures are all around, without us realizing.  It is much easier putting something into a data structure than writing redundant, repetitive code.  The run time for data structures is much less than it would be doing it a different way.

•	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Trial and error and tutoring helped tremendously for this project.  There were a couple of times that I had no idea how to fix a problem, and tutoring would give me the help I needed.

•	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project has challenged me to think about the way I interpret and produce programs.  The algorithms we learned are extremely helpful in producing a program.

•	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This has by far been the most challenging project I have worked on.  This project has tested my patience many times.  Adaptable, maintainable, and readable programs are important in any atmosphere with coding.  This project, and this course has definitely pushed me to work on that more with every assignment.
